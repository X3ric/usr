All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.\n\nFAQ: Does OneTab work on the Android version of Firefox?\nA: The latest version Includes experimental support for the upcoming Firefox Android release. Please note that Android currently does not allow you to save to OneTab any \"discarded\" tabs. A discarded tab is one that looks like an open tab in your list of tabs, but that Firefox does not consider active and is not stored in RAM. This is a bug in Firefox for Android that looks likely to be resolved by Mozilla within a few months.","weeklyDownloads":2286,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/269/269564.png?modified=1652891576","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/269/269564.jpg?modified=1652891576","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1642,"reviewCount":1125,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1696342139000},{"id":"{a6c4a591-f1b2-4f03-b3ff-767e5bedf4e7}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-32.png?modified=a1617cd0","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-64.png?modified=a1617cd0","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/853/853731-128.png?modified=a1617cd0"},"name":"User-Agent Switcher and Manager","version":"0.5.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4098688/user_agent_string_switcher-0.5.0.xpi","homepageURL":"http://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html","supportURL":"https://add0n.com/useragent-switcher.html","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher/","description":"Spoof websites trying to gather information about your web navigation—like your browser type and operating system—to deliver distinct content you may not want.","fullDescription":"Usage example: You can alter your user-agent string to indicate you’re on a mobile device if you prefer seeing mobile versions of sites so they load quicker.\n\n--\n\nThis extension allows you to spoof your browser \"user-agent\" string to a custom designation, making it impossible for websites to know specific details about your browsing arrangement.\n\nOverviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aVFxvF3N_E\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M6_Zc4o1MQ\n\nNotes:\n1.

browser speed and reduce memory load and when you have numerous open tabs.","fullDescription":"\"Auto Tab Discard\" is a lightweight browser extension that automatically reduces the amount of memory used by open but inactive tabs, helping to conserve battery life on portable devices by disabling JavaScript code and DOM events on discarded tabs.\n\nPreview:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ityhxUPp3y8\n\nInstruction:\n\nThere are two options on the extension's interface to either discard tabs or release discarding (the \"x\" buttons)\n\n\nThe features of \"Auto Tab Discard\" are:\n\n* Improves browser performance and reduces memory usage by automatically or manually discarding inactive, idle, or forgotten tabs.\n* Includes a list of hostnames or regular expressions that can be excluded from auto-discarding.\n* Preserves the discarded state of tabs when the browser is closed and reopened.\n* Indicates the discarded state of a tab through the favicon or title.\n* Restores the state of a tab, including scroll position and text box content, after it is released from being discarded.\n* Allows for the forced discarding of specified hostnames.\n\n\nThe options for configuring whether tabs should be discarded or not include:\n\n* Pinned tabs\n* Tabs that are playing media\n* The presence of a power source\n* Unsaved content or user input in a tab\n\nThe available plugins for \"Auto Tab Discard\" are:\n\n* Release the discarded state of the next or previous tab.\n* Release the discarded state of all tabs in the active window.\n* Automatically discard all newly opened inactive tabs.\n* Store YouTube's timestamp before a tab is discarded.\n* Permanently delete (remove) old discarded tabs that are inactive.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Unlike the \"The Great Suspender\" extension, this extension uses the native method for discarding tabs, which means that even if the extension is removed or the browser crashes, your browser will automatically restore everything for you.\n\nPrivacy
